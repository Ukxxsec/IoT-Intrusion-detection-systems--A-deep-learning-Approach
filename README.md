IoT Network Intrusion Detection System

Welcome to the repository for the IoT Network Intrusion Detection System. This guide will help you set up and run the project, including the web application and Jupyter notebook analysis.

Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Visual Studio Code (or any preferred IDE with terminal support)
Anaconda
Git (optional, for cloning the repository)
Setup Instructions

Step 1: Download the Project Files
Clone this repository or download the zipped project files directly. The zipped file is named IoT_network_intrusion_detection_system-Raw_code-Dataset-Model_files.zip and it includes all necessary datasets and the pre-trained model.

Step 2: Import the Code into Jupyter Notebook
After downloading, extract the files and import the folder into Jupyter Notebook to access and run the code. Ensure you have Jupyter installed, or you can use Google Colab if preferred.

Step 3: Set Up and Run the Web Application
Download the Web App:

Follow this link follow the link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V9MaGrbpLkubg4MPtF0lejHW34unfrWv to download the web application files from Google Drive.
Prepare the Environment:

Open the downloaded folder in Visual Studio Code.
Run the App.py file
Open a new terminal in VS Code and set up a virtual environment with the following commands:

python -m venv venv

venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the application by entering:
python app.py
Upon successfully running the command, an IP address will be displayed in the terminal.
Access the Web App:

Copy and paste the provided IP address into your browser to view and interact with the web application. The app should display form fields for interacting with the model.

Copy the Parameters for the webapp from this dataset csv file in the  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V9MaGrbpLkubg4MPtF0lejHW34unfrWv, fill out each field in the webapp form and submit to get the result of the test.

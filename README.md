Thank you for clicking the Link, the first folder contain all the files for the development of the project.
step One 
download the IoT
The Zipped folder contains all the python files, iterations of Datasets and the models used.
They are in the same structure as they are on my System so it will run easily when imported in Jupyter notebook.
I have also uploaded the Files for the webapp but was unable to upload the whole folder because it was large and github didnt allow the upload.
Thank you for Assessing.
